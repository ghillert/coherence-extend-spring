# Coherence*Extend Example using Coherence Spring

See: https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/standalone/coherence/14.1.1.0/develop-remote-clients/building-your-first-extend-application.html#GUID-6FFEAAD8-C2BE-49A4-A349-58DD854A242C

Build the project:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

Start the server

```bash
java -jar coherence-extend-demo-server/target/coherence-extend-demo-server-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Start the client application

```bash
java -jar coherence-extend-demo-app/target/coherence-extend-demo-app-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Open your browser with address http://localhost:8080/hello

You should see the word `world` printed.

## Coherence and Spring Boot without Coherence Spring

Module `coherence-extend-demo-app-plain` demonstrates the use of _Coherence_ with Spring Boot *without* _Coherence Spring_.
The application behaves the same as module `coherence-extend-demo-app`. Simply start the app with:

```bash
java -jar coherence-extend-demo-app/target/coherence-extend-demo-app-plain-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Open your browser with address http://localhost:8080/hello

You should see the word `world` printed. Additionally open http://localhost:8080/hello/

This will return the entire map of 2 entries. 1 entry being added by the server app on startup:

```
{"server":"says hello","hello":"world"}
```
